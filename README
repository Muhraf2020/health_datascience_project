a concrete example to show you how to develop R code for data exploration and hospital readmission prediction. The intention here is not to build a model with high accuracy but to demonstrate a step-by-step approach to data exploration, preprocessing, and model development in healthcare. By the end, you will not only understand the specific steps for this case but also gain valuable skills in using R for data science in healthcare.
